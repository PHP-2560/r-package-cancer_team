# This is some started code that I got from online at 
# http://www.analyticsforfun.com/2013/09/my-first-r-shiny-web-application-using.html#gpluscomments

# I would like to use some of the code to get started on my map, my map will include data for the U.S. only and will give the user the ability to calculate their risk for CRC using paraemeters that the user clicks on such as sex, Race/Ethnicity, age, state, annual income, and bmi.
